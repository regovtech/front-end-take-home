Hey! We are excited that you are interested in joining the team at Regov Technologies.

We feel that the best place to really show us your skills is somewhere you feel comfortable. This test should not take you a long amount of time to complete.

This take home test is used to determine how you go about solving problems logically, as well as building out easy to use, performant user interfaces. The test is very open to interpretation.

### Coding Challenge

Build an app containing a typeahead input field.
A user should be able to type into, and while typing it should show possible results based on that input; the user should be able to select a result to populate the field.
Add a feature that accept user comment and display the entry below.

Feel free to decide on implementation design and the concepts.

Example: https://reactcommunity.org/react-autocomplete/async-data/

Sample API to use: https://restcountries.eu/

Feel free to use a Mock API.

### User Stories (Requirements)

- As a user I can start typing into the field, and filtered results will show up as I type
- As a user I can select a result and it will populate the input.
- As a user I can see the matching filter in bold in the results. (ie. **Mal**aysia Selangor)
- As a user I can view all possible results at any time during my input.
- As a user I can view App on Mobile, Tablet or Desktop.
- As a user I can comment on the page and do the following to the comment: view, update, delete, and save draft.

Feel free to go above and beyond if you have ideas for extra features!
