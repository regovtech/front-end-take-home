Hey! We are excited that you are interested in joining the team at Regov Technologies.

We feel that the best place to really show us your skills is somewhere you feel comfortable. This test should not take you a long amount of time to complete.

This take home test is used to determine how you go about solving problems logically, as well as building out easy to use, performant user interfaces. This test is very open to interpretation and implementation.

### Coding Challenge

AS a user I can do the following :

- Register with my personal details( name, address, postcode, city, country, email, username) on the App. 2FA by email to activate account.
- During registration I can upload my international passport and identity card (e.g license or national id). 
  Only jpg/png is allowed.
- Preview my inputs and images on a different page that has a button to either return to personal information page to update information or submit the form.
- I can update my personal details after account is activated.
